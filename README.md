Dyslexia dot-jump experiment design considerations
We like the idea of making the distribution of dot positions non-uniform, so we can see whether dyslexics make use of the prior less.  The obvious way to do that is by making particular angles (e.g., northeast and east) more likely. However, this is not ideal because it may also bias participants' fixation positions- they'd tend to move their eyes in that direction. 
An alternative, then, is to bias the distribution of radius, making certain eccentricities more likely. In fact, Brenner et al. (2008)

already documented a low-eccentricity bias, and we could see whether dyslexics do that, and if they're responsive to other contingencies. BTW, it seems to me that because eccentricity isn't a circular variable, any natural incorporation of priors would cause one to be biased towards lower eccentricities, as that would reduce mean error. I don't know if you know what I mean, nor do I know whether Brenner et al. addressed this.
