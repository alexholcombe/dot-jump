We're collecting data, so here's a breakdown of what each dataset represents. 

* variableCue: This is an exogenous cue, a circle surrounding all possible positions. The SOA was 66.667ms, the presentation time was 22.22ms

* endogenousCue: In this experiment, there is an RSVP stream at fixation while the dot moves. The timing of the RSVP stream and the dot are the same. The target is a numeral in a stream of letters. The initial timing parameters were too fast (I think, yet to model it). They were 66.667ms for the SOA, 22.222ms for the presentation time. The first "CL" data were collected under these conditions. I slowed the presentation time down to 94.12ms for the SOA and 23.52ms for the presentation time. These represent 8 and 2 frames of an 85Hz monitor.
